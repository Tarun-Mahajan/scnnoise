# scNNoiSE: Single-cell Network-aware Noise Simulator for gene Expression
A C++ simulator for single-cell stochastic gene expression. scNNoiSE uses Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm for modeling bursty gene expression. Multiple models of gene expression are available, and the simulator is flexible enough to add custom models as well. The key benefits of scNNoiSE are:

1. Simulating stochastic gene expression over gene regulatory networks
2. Different models of gene expression including the twio-state telegraph model, and bursty gene expression model. Extendible to custom models

NOTE: Documentation in progress. Shortly, will be adding experiments to demonstrate usage examples for different gene expression models.
